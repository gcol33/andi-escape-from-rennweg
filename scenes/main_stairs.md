You turn right and walk toward the main stairwell. Just as you reach the landing, Agnes from HR steps out, blocking your path.

She holds a single, thick manila envelope and smiles a very thin smile.

"Andy. Perfect timing. Just a quick document I need you to sign before you are officially off the premises. Standard exit protocol."

### Choices

- Sign the document without reading it. → document_signed
- Refuse to sign and ask what it is. → document_refusal
- Try to walk around Agnes, pretending not to hear. → attempt_pass
