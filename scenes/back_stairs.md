You turn left toward the back stairwell, but before you reach it, you hear a frantic whispering from the office next door.

Two colleagues, Joni and Norbert, step out, looking desperate. Joni is frantically clutching a printed thesis draft.

"Andy! Thank God! You're the only one who knows the Bayesian Multi-Variate Regression with Inverse Propensity Weighting. My PhD submission is today, and it just crashed! Please, you have to help me!"

### Choices

- Sit at the desk and help them fix the model. → lost_to_PhD
- Say, "Sorry, guys, I'm out of here. Good luck." → colleague_plea
- Say, "FUCK OFF." → corridor_safe
