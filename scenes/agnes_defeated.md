Agnes staggers back, clutching her manila folder to her chest like a shield.

"I... I can't believe it. No one has ever resisted HR before."

She drops the folder. Papers scatter across the floor - your "exit interview" forms, all pre-filled with answers you never gave.

"Fine. Go. But mark my words, Andy... HR *always* remembers."

---

She retreats into the shadows of the stairwell. The path to freedom is clear.
