  - Coffee Mug
---

You step into the kitchen. It is eerily quiet. The coffee machine is running, smelling comfortingly familiar.

---

You pour yourself a mug. The warmth feels good in your hands. You could drink it now... or save it for later.

**You picked up a Coffee Mug!**

### Choices

- Drink it now. One last sip for the road. [sfx: gulp.ogg] → coffee_drunk
- Save it for later. Time to leave. [sfx: footstep.ogg] → hallway_return
