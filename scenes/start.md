The old wooden door closes with a dull thud behind you for the very last time. Your badge no longer works; your desk is empty.

---

You stand in the dim hallway of the 1st floor, where scuffed tile stretches ahead and the overhead fluorescents hum their familiar drone.

Your new job starts Monday, and this chapter is finally closed. Now, you just need to get to the entrance and head out to freedom.

### Choices

- Turn right and take the main stairs down to the entrance. → main_stairs
- Turn left and take the back stairs to the main entrance. → back_stairs
- Get one last, sentimental cup of coffee in the kitchen near your office. → coffee_kitchen
