You step back into the hallway, coffee in hand. The warmth is comforting.

As you turn the corner, you nearly walk straight into Agnes from HR. She's standing right there, blocking the corridor.

She holds a single, thick manila envelope and smiles a very thin smile.

"Andy. Perfect timing. Just a quick document I need you to sign before you are officially off the premises. Standard exit protocol."

### Choices

- Sign the document without reading it. [sfx: click.ogg] → document_signed
- Refuse to sign and ask what it is. [sfx: negative.ogg] → document_refusal
- Try to walk around Agnes, pretending not to hear. [sfx: footstep.ogg] → attempt_pass
