You shake off Joni and step firmly into the corridor, only to be immediately intercepted by Fabio and Ali.

"Andy! Leaving already? Just wanted to say hello and wish you luck!"

After a few minutes of pleasantries, Ali adds, "Oh, you didn't say bye to the fourth floor folks, did you? Michi, Gilles, and Ruling will never forgive you!"

### Choices

- Agree to take the elevator up to the 4th floor. → fourth_floor_elevator
- Say "I don't have time!" and run for the stairs. → corridor_safe
