You mutter a quick "Gotta run!" and try to dart past Agnes.

You are fast, but Agnes is known to have a hidden history as a competitive ballroom dancer.

**You must roll a d20 (13 or lower to succeed).**

How will you attempt to evade her?

### Choices

- Sprint past her! (Normal roll) [sfx: dice_roll.ogg] → attempt_pass_normal
- Throw coffee in her face first! (uses: Coffee Mug) [sfx: gulp.ogg] → attempt_pass_advantage
- Just try to squeeze by carefully... [sfx: footstep.ogg] → attempt_pass_disadvantage
