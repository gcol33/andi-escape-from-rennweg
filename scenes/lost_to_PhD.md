You sit down and dive into the code. The problem is deep, fascinating, and consumes your entire focus.

You hear the door swing shut, but you don't look up. You solve the bug, then another, and another.

Next time you check the time, the digital clock reads: **2035**.

You cannot remember the names of the people who asked you for help. You have merged with the job.

**You lost the game.**
